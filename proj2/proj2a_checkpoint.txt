The project 2 checkpoint has been released and will be due Tuesday October 30 at 11:59 PM. Note the website previously said 11/5, but the checkpoint has been lightened and the date has been moved up to encourage starting earlier.

The checkpoint is made up of two components: a conceptual check, which you will submit through Google Forms and a code check, composed of 3 unit tests which you must pass for credit. This is aimed to give you an introduction to the project (the methods tested are a small fraction of the overall project) and get you to start early!
 
The conceptual check is a short quiz that tests for understanding of the project. You should be able to complete it after reading the project spec. A full score on the quiz requires sufficient effort. The quiz is here.
 
The code check has 3 unit tests that test parts of the following methods:
	•	Board.java
	◦	void init()
	◦	final void put(Piece p, Square s)
	◦	final Piece get(int col, int row)
	◦	public String toString()
	•	Square.java
	◦	boolean isQueenMove(Square to)
	◦	Square (constructor)
 
To receive the unit tests to run them locally:
	1.	In your repo, run git fetch shared 
	2.	Run git merge shared/proj2a -m “proj2a” 
	3.	Copy the unit tests in proj2a/UnitTest.java file into your proj2/amazons/UnitTest.java file (or anywhere else in the project as you desire). 
 
You should be implementing everything in your proj2 folder. We will only be grading your proj2 folder and not your proj2a folder. Tag your checkpoint submission as proj2a-x where x is the submission number.
